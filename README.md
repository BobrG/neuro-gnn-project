# neuro-gnn-project

**Project description:** Project is dedicated to interpretation of deep learning models in medical domain. The main goal was to experiment with recent work on interpretable graph NNs -- [IBGNN](https://github.com/HennyJie/IBGNN)
and check out it ability to extract biomarkers used for classification of Schizophrenia ([COBRE dataset](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html)).
Also, the experiments with non-learnable (baseline) methods of DL models interpretation were conducted on sMRI data ([ADNI open-source dataset](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)).

Future work:
* Finish analysis of the GNN results -- compare healthy/nonhealthy patient's brain networks, check on the consistency of network scores.
* Check GNN model behaviour on sMRI data
